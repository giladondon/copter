# copter
ASM final project of highSchool
My Assembly final project is based on well-known games such as the original copter game (which was made by David McCandless in 2000)
and the addictive flappy bird smartphones' game (which was made by Nguyễn Hà Đông in 2013).

All of the code in the project was written by me, some copter key features (code speaking) are:
- Seperate code logic & graphic
- Minimal use of memory space
- Efficient graphic use
- Smart use of random values
for a more detailed explanation of copter I encourage you to visit: https://prezi.com/aakgd9_n3cqv/copter

The main file of the project is mainGame.asm, it includes all other files (porcedures files) and uses the .pcx files, in other words,
compile this file (as long you have all the other files in the same directory) and you got yourself a game.
